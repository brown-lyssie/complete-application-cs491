# Lab: Building a Complete application

## 1. Overview
The goal of this lab is to see if we can build a complete game database from scratch within the three hour lecture session.

## 2. Data Requirements
We are building a game database
Each game has an name, a description, a primary operating system, and a brand.
The operating system and brand should be selectable from a dropdown lists.
The operating system information should include the name and the maker of the system.
The brand should include the name.
The user should be able to go a particular operating system page and see a list of all the games that support that system.
When the user views the page for a brand, they should see a list of all the games produced by that brand.

## 3. Multiple Users
Many users can accese the system at the same time. When a user adds a game, it should immediately show up all other usersâ€™ game list (the index page).
